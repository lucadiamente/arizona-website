                    <p>No round up of the best things to see and do in Arizona is complete without a nod to the Grand Canyon. Its vast scale never fails to impress: standing at 277 miles long, up to 18 miles wide and 1 mile deep, there's plenty to explore. From guided tours and whitewater rafting trips, to educational adventures and countless photo ops, you'll never be bored at the Grand Canyon!</p>

                    <h3>Food</h3>
                    <p>With all the hiking and exploring you'll be doing in Arizona, you're gonna need some sustenance right? Fortunately, the state has a wide variety of cuisines thanks to multiple influences on its culinary culture - so there's sure to be something for every taste. Migration to the state from South and Midwest America, as well as influences left by Indigenous and early Mexican settlers, have all left their mark.</p>

                    <h2>What Month is best to visit Arizona?</h2>
                    <h4>November and then March, and April are pretty great months to visit. December and January are too, but it can be a little wet - but the temperatures are still glorious. If you come in March and April, you can enjoy both Phoenix and the Grand Canyon, as it won't be as cold up there.</h4>
